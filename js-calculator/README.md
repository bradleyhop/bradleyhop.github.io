# js-calculator

This calculator fulfills the ["Front End Libraries Projects - Build a JavaScript Calculator"](href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator")
project for freeCodeCamp. The design is inspired by one of the first scientific calculators,
the Texas Instruments SR-10.

## Technologies

This app uses Vue CLI, Sass, and the [math.js](https://mathjs.org) library to
handle the calculations and arithmetic operations using formula/expression
logic. I also implemented Open Graph metadata for social media car preview and
SEO. A custom font is loaded for the calculator's display display.

## Live Build

The live app is found [here](https://bradleyhop.github.io/js-calculator/).
