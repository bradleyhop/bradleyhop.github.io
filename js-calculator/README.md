# js-calculator

This calculator fulfills the ["Front End Libraries Projects - Build a JavaScript Calculator"](href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator")
project for freeCodeCamp. The design is inspired by one of the first scientific calculators,
the Texas Instruments SR-10.

This app uses Vue CLI, Sass, and the [math.js](https://mathjs.org) library to
handle the calculations and arithmetic operations using formula/expression logic.
There are 7 places of precision chosen to reflect the SR-10's display limitations.

The live app is found [here](https://bradleyhop.github.io/js-calculator/).
