# drum-machine

This project was first built using locally linked cdn's to render the Sass and Vue libraries.

Now, I use the official [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org) to write this app modularly. The build is deployed on another [github repository](https://github.com/bradleyhop/drumMachine).

The live app is found [here](https://bradleyhop.github.io/drumMachine/index.html)

Here are [requirements and user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) for this freecodecamp.org project.
