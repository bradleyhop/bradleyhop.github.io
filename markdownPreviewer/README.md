This markdown previewer is made with the [ marked ](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), [ highlight.js ](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), and [ Vue.js ](https://vuejs.org/) libraries.

This freeCodeCamp challenge currently does not satisfy the automated testing suite requirements. This is because I'm using Vue.js to complete this challenge, which is not currently supported by the development team at this time. [Here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/testable-projects-fcc/issues/31) is the github issue tracker, which is closed, discussing the challenge of implementing vue.js with their current testing suite.

Regardless, I have satisfied all user stories and consider this challenge complete.
