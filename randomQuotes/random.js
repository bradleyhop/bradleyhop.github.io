Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure „programmer productivity“ in terms of „number of lines of code produced“. In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to „the number of lines of code spent“.","author":"Edsger W.

Three workers require three times as much pairwise intercommunication as two; four require six times as much as two.","author":"Fred Brooks"},{"en":"Having a system architect is the most important single step toward conceptual integrity. After teaching a software engineering laboratory more than 20 times, I came to insist that student teams as small as four people choose a manager and a separate architect.","author":"Fred Brooks"},{"en":"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz. with the programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer's own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be \"almost correct\", afterwards a program with an error is just \"wrong\".","author":"Edsger W.

It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.","author":"Steve Jobs"},{"en":"Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are typically simple and clear.

You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.","author":"Marijn Haverbeke"},{"en":"Computers themselves can do only stupidly straightforward things. The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at an incredibly high speed.","author":"Marijn Haverbeke"},{"en":"A program is a building of thought.

Wouldn't it be a hell of a lot quicker if we just didn't create the bugs in the first place?","author":"Martin Fowler"},{"en":"The situation is so much better for programmers today - a cheap used PC, a linux CD, and an internet account, and you have all the tools necessary to work your way to any level of programming skill you want to shoot for.","author":"John Carmack"},{"en":"The best thing software can be is easy, but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limit users' choices.","author":"Paul Graham (programmer)"},{"en":"The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.","author":"Paul Graham (programmer)"},{"en":"There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.","author":"Paul Graham (programmer)"},{"en":"Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.","author":"Bill Gates"},{"en":"We're no longer in the days where everything is super well crafted.

But by and large I think it's a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.","author":"Ken Thompson"},{"en":"No matter how correct a mathematical theorem may appear to be, one ought never to be satisfied that there was not something imperfect about it until it also gives the impression of being beautiful.","author":"George Boole"},{"en":"The Analytical Engine does not occupy common ground with mere 'calculating machines.' It holds a position wholly its own, and the considerations it suggests are more interesting in their nature.","author":"Ada Lovelace"},{"en":"The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value.","author":"Ada Lovelace"},{"en":"In the case of the Analytical Engine, we have undoubtedly to lay out a certain capital of analytical labour in one particular line, but this is in order that the engine may bring us in a much larger return in another line.","author":"Ada Lovelace"},{"en":"We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.","author":"Ada Lovelace"},{"en":"The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method.","author":"George Boole"},{"en":"Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. For, as has been pointed out several times, there is no such thing as a random number.","author":"John von Neumann"},{"en":"There is not only a close analogy between the operations of the mind in general reasoning and its operations in the particular science of Algebra, but there is to a considerable extent an exact agreement in the laws by which the two classes of operations are conducted.","author":"George Boole"},{"en":"A large part of mathematics which becomes useful developed with absolutely no desire to be useful, and in a situation where nobody could possibly know in what area it would become useful.","author":"John von Neumann"},{"en":"The amateur software engineer is always in search of magic, some sensational method or tool whose application promises to render software development trivial.

One way to minimize the risk of a prototype being put into production is to write the prototype in using a language or tool that you couldn't possibly use for a production version.","author":"Joseph Yoder (computer scientist)"},{"en":"Sadly, architecture has been undervalued for so long that many engineers regard life with a Big Ball of Mud as normal.","author":"Joseph Yoder (computer scientist)"},{"en":"The real problem with throwaway code comes when it isn't thrown away.","author":"Joseph Yoder (computer scientist)"},{"en":"Sometimes it’s just easier to throw a system away, and start over.","author":"Joseph Yoder (computer scientist)"},{"en":"The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones.

Peter Deutsch"},{"en":"The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.","author":"John Locke"},{"en":"The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.","author":"Anonymous"},{"en":"It turns out that style matters in programming for the same reason that it matters in writing. It makes for better reading.","author":"Douglas Crockford"},{"en":"Computer programs are the most complex things that humans make.","author":"Douglas Crockford"},{"en":"Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts.

One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability.","author":"Vannevar Bush"},{"en":"Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite. The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the technical debt load.","author":"Ward Cunningham"},{"en":"Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice.","author":"Martin Fowler"},{"en":"One of the important implications of technical debt is that it must be serviced. If the debt grows large enough, eventually the company will spend more on servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other assets.","author":"Steve McConnell"},{"en":"What's very important from my point of view is that there is one web.
