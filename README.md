# bradleyhop.github.io

A mega-repository for my personal portfolio page and all projects for the
[freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

## Layout of this repo

Each folder contains a separate project for the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Please
see my [portfolio page](https://bradleyhop.github.io) for a categorized
presentation of my projects with links to the live page and github repository.

The files in the root directory are responsible for the portfolio project for freeCodeCamp.
